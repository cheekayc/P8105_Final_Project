### The tentative project title

A French Bakery’s Daily Sales in 2021-2022

### The motivation for this project

It is 10:05 am in the morning, you sit in the lecture hall having your
earliest lecture of the day Data Science, empty-stomached. A cup of
coffee and a nicely warmed chocolate croissant or as French says ‘Pain
Au Chocolat’ is the only thing existing in your mind… You wonder why the
bakery items are so good and what you can do with it accompanied with
the ongoing endless talking of data science explained by your energetic
professor… Well, you jumped online and searched datasets for a French
bakery and here it happens…

Bread is so much a part of French culture that even the word for
“friend” comes from Latin cum pane (with bread) meaning the person with
whom you break bread. These everyday bakery items can still be something
of a mystery to people like you and me (I mean, who doesn’t like carbs?)

In this journey, we will take you around the analysis of a typical
French bakery and find out what’s the best-seller, how much they sell,
how is the sale distributed and so much more…

### The intended final products

A report regarding the distribution of sales of bread in a French bakery
and providing visualizations via different plots.

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

#### Analyses

-   Anova Test: If the mean number of the sales are different for summer
    (Jun - Aug) and winter (Dec - Feb)

-   One sample t-test: If the price of baguette in this store is the
    same as the average price of baguette across the France (To compare
    average price of different bakery products in France, refer to
    `price comparison`)

-   Linear regression: If there is a linear relationship between the
    price and counts.

#### Visualizations

-   A pie chart showing the percentage of each product’s sale count

-   A line plot of trends showing total sale revenue by month (trend)

-   A scatterplot of distributions of counts for a specific bread by
    months from 2021 to 2022

-   A bar chart showing the popularity of products (measured in sale
    counts from lowest to highest)

-   A bar chart showing prices of products from lowest to highest

#### Coding challenges

-   We must learn the appropriate codes to carry out the analyses
    proposed above.

-   It would take some time to do mapping

-   Since the data has too many rows, we would have to filter the data.
    Also, there are too many factors contributed to the sale counts and
    revenue.
